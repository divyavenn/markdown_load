Let me show you how to read a deep learning research paper. You'll see it's pretty simple, a bit counter-attractive. First off, don't read the paper. You should start by immersing yourself through tutorial blogs or conference in the material. It will spoil you the findings, but it will allow you to see the landmarks faster. Second step, you read the paper from start to finish and fill in the external gap you are missing. By external I mean the theory or result that are not explained in the paper but are crucial for understanding. Third step, you dive deep into the paper methodology, code and results. This part will require you multiple read and to open up the code base if available to study the implementation. Finally, you should read back the paper slowly one last time in order to figure out all the blind spots you have. There are many types of blind spots but in general after the final read you should be all good to reproduce the paper. Good luck!
