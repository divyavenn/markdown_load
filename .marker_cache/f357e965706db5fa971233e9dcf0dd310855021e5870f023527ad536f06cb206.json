{"text": "2. Lighter approaches like prompting and RAG are quick to deploy but **can't achieve the same depth** of capability.\n\nThis creates a stark choice for businesses: Either commit significant resources to build truly capable custom AI, or settle for surface-level solutions that may not fully meet their needs. Moreover, both paths require specialized technical expertise that most organizations lack, making AI customization a complex and risky investment.\n\n## **Solution**\n\nBread lets you train ('bake') new models **just by talking to them**â€”by explicitly teaching the model with natural language. Like training a human! Forget expensive massive datasets and complex pipelines; this simple, explicit method lets a non-technical person make nuanced, powerful updates possible with minimal effort. If you know how to teach others using your words, you already know how to build and improve new models using Bread. **Bread supplies the depth of training (weight updates) with the simplicity of explicit natural language.**\n\nThis capability is powered by our \"baking operator\" as described in Prompt Baking [\\(arXiv:2409.13697\\)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13697) to convert explicit natural language prompts into permanent and composable weight updates. See [Bread's Technical Differentiation Document](https://docsend.com/view/x5xugmi3di5zqk7z) for further details on our technical edge.\n\n### **Business Model**\n\nBread will offer its technology as a service that enables businesses to transfer human expertise to custom AI models in a natural, high-bandwidth manner. We envision a dynamic **federation** of AI and human collaborators that evolves seamlessly to address fundamental business needs. Bread can sell directly to enterprises such as Geico and Intuit or collaborate with hyperscalers to reach their customers. These systems will be hosted on the hyperscaler of the customer's choice (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). Bread enables businesses to create, refine, and deploy AI solutions that evolve by the hour, empowering them to remain competitive in an ever-changing landscape.\n\nOne-Pager 2"}
