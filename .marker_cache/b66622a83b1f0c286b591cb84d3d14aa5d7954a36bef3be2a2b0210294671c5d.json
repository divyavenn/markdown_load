However, there is a significant business opportunity in addressing custom tasks that demand domain-specific expertise and proprietary or novel data. These include areas such as:\n\n- Decision support systems\n- Robust agentic Al workflows\n- Research assistants\n- Coding models\n- Customer service representatives\n- Specialist Al workers (e.g., claims adjusters, healthcare administrators)\n\nCustom AI models must be tailored to their use case, creating a demand for **natural**, **high-bandwidth** ways to transfer human expertise to the AI.\n\n# **Problem**\n\nToday's methods for tailoring custom AI models force an expensive trade-off between\n\n1. **Deep integration** of expertise through training (fine-tuning, RLHF, DPO) requires massive investment in data, compute, and time.\n\nOne-Pager /"}
